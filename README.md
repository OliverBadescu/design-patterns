# Design Patterns in Java

This repository contains implementations of various design patterns in Java, focusing on providing clear examples and explanations for each pattern.


Each pattern directory contains:
- `README.md` - Detailed explanation of the pattern
- `example/` - Java implementation with example usage

## Creational Design Patterns

Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

### 1. [Abstract Factory Pattern](src/creational_design_patterns/abstract_factory_pattern/README.md)
Creates families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. Useful when you need to create multiple related products.

**Example**: Vehicle manufacturing system with different factories for luxury and economy vehicles.

### 2. [Builder Pattern](src/creational_design_patterns/builder_pattern/README.md)
Constructs complex objects step by step. Separates the construction process from the representation.

**Example**: Computer assembly system where you can build computers with different specifications.

### 3. [Factory Pattern](src/creational_design_patterns/factory_pattern/README.md)
Creates objects without specifying their exact class. Provides a common interface for creating objects of different types.

**Example**: Vehicle factory that creates cars, trucks, or motorcycles based on input parameters.

### 4. [Prototype Pattern](src/creational_design_patterns/prototype_pattern/README.md)
Creates objects by cloning existing instances. Useful when object creation is expensive or complex.

**Example**: Document management system that creates new documents by cloning existing templates.

### 5. [Singleton Pattern](src/creational_design_patterns/singleton_pattern/README.md)
Ensures a class has only one instance and provides global access to it. Commonly used for database connections, loggers, and configuration managers.

**Example**: Database connection manager that maintains a single connection instance.

## Structural Design Patterns

Structural patterns deal with object composition, creating relationships between objects to form larger structures.

### 1. [Adapter Pattern](src/structural_design_patterns/adapter_pattern/README.md)
Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by creating a wrapper that converts one interface to another.

**Example**: Audio player system that can play different media formats through adapters.

### 2. [Bridge Pattern](src/structural_design_patterns/bridge_pattern/README.md)
Separates abstraction from implementation, allowing both to vary independently.

**Example**: Shape rendering system with different renderers (Vector, Raster) for various shapes.

### 3. [Composite Pattern](src/structural_design_patterns/composite_pattern/README.md)
Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies, treating individual and composite objects uniformly.

**Example**: File system hierarchy with files and directories.

### 4. [Decorator Pattern](src/structural_design_patterns/decorator_pattern/README.md)
Dynamically adds new functionality to objects without altering their structure by wrapping them in decorator objects.

**Example**: Coffee ordering system where you can add various ingredients to customize your coffee.

### 5. [Facade Pattern](src/structural_design_patterns/facade_pattern/README.md)
Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to use.

**Example**: Computer startup system that coordinates CPU, memory, graphics card, and hard drive.

### 6. [Flyweight Pattern](src/structural_design_patterns/flyweight_pattern/README.md)
Minimizes memory usage by sharing efficiently common data among multiple objects.

**Example**: Forest rendering system that shares tree type data among many tree instances.

### 7. [Proxy Pattern](src/structural_design_patterns/proxy_pattern/README.md)
Provides a placeholder or surrogate for another object to control access to it.

**Example**: Image loading system with lazy loading and caching functionality.

## Behavioral Design Patterns

Behavioral patterns focus on communication between objects and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

### 1. [Chain of Responsibility Pattern](src/behavioral_design_patterns/chain_of_responsibility_pattern/README.md)
Passes requests along a chain of handlers, where each handler decides either to process the request or pass it to the next handler.

**Example**: Support ticket system where different support levels handle tickets based on priority.

### 2. [Command Pattern](src/behavioral_design_patterns/command_pattern/README.md)
Turns requests into stand-alone objects containing all information about the request, allowing parameterization, queuing, and undo operations.

**Example**: Smart home automation system with remote control that can execute, undo, and group commands into macros.
